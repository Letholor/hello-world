# hello-world
Tutorial on GitHub. I'm going to learn how to be a good programmer one day, and this is just the beginning.
I am Letholor. I am learning to program and my primary language is Java so far. I have done some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, PHP, and a touch of Ruby. I am still on a learning path to open up my own Software Development business.
